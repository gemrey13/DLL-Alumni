Great! A system that combines an Alumni Tracer with curriculum analysis can provide valuable insights into the career paths of graduates and how well the curriculum prepares them for their chosen fields. Here's an outline of how you can structure the system in Django:

Define Models:
Create models to represent the entities in your system. Here's an example of possible models:
Graduate: Represents a graduate with fields such as name, graduation year, program, current position, and contact information.
Curriculum: Represents the curriculum with fields such as program name, courses, and program objectives.
Course: Represents an individual course with fields such as course code, title, description, and credits.
EmploymentRecord: Represents the employment history of a graduate with fields such as job title, employer, start and end dates, and job description.
Implement Tracer Study Functionality:
Create views and templates to handle the tracer study functionality, such as displaying a list of graduates, adding new graduates, editing graduate information, and tracking their employment records. You can refer to the example provided earlier for the tracer study system.

Implement Curriculum Analysis Functionality:
To analyze the curriculum, you can consider the following features:

Display Curriculum Details: Create a view to display the details of a specific curriculum, including the program name, courses included, program objectives, and any other relevant information.

Course List: Create a view to list all the courses in the curriculum, along with their details. This can include course codes, titles, descriptions, and credits.

Curriculum Comparison: Implement a feature to compare different curriculum versions or programs. This can involve selecting multiple curricula and displaying a side-by-side comparison of their courses and objectives.

Graduate Feedback: Provide a way for graduates to provide feedback on the curriculum they studied. This can be in the form of surveys or questionnaires to gather their opinions on how well the curriculum prepared them for their careers.

Analyze Employment Records: Utilize the employment records of graduates to assess the relevance and effectiveness of the curriculum. You can generate statistics and reports to analyze the types of jobs graduates secure, the industries they work in, average salaries, and the time it takes to find employment after graduation.

Data Visualization:
Consider implementing data visualization techniques to present the analyzed data in a more meaningful and understandable way. This can include charts, graphs, and tables to represent employment outcomes, curriculum comparisons, and other relevant metrics.

User Authentication and Access Control:
Implement user authentication and access control to restrict certain functionalities to authorized users. This can include administrative features, such as managing curricula or viewing sensitive data.

Remember to design your database schema accordingly and set up relationships between the models (e.g., foreign keys) to establish the necessary connections.

By combining the tracer study system with curriculum analysis, you can gain valuable insights into how well the curriculum aligns with the career outcomes of graduates and identify areas for improvement.
